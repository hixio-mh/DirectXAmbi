DirectXAmbi
===========

This is a Ambilight driver for windows which uses DirectX9.

It uses the WS2812 library from: https://github.com/cpldcpu/light_ws2812 
Because i've never done assembly before ;)
Later on I'm thinking of writing my own replacement for it that maybe is even more efficient.


You need to install the DirectX SDK to compile it.

It works right now. There no known errors or bugs.
If you find any please report them

It first startup it will start a wizard to help you configure the software.
It is all terminal based currently, because I hate it to create UI's.
Comments are all in dutch.
