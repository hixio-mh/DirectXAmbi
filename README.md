DirectXAmbi
===========

This is a Ambilight driver for windows which uses DirectX9.

It uses the WS2812 library from: https://github.com/cpldcpu/light_ws2812 
Because i've never done assembly before ;)
Later on I'm thinking of writing my own replacement for it that maybe is even more efficient.


You need to install the DirectX SDK to compile it.

It works right now. There no known errors or bugs.
If you find any please report them

It has NO UI yet. There is a screen selection at the start of the program.
All settings must be done currently in code.
Comments are all in dutch.
